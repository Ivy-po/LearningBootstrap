# Instructions 

## Task 1 - `bears.html`
Edit the `bears.html` document so that each section of the page has the width indicated by the heading and the comments.

Remember that you should use the full screen preview to view your changes. You should only be editing `bears.html`. You can use `index.html` as a reference.

1. First add the appropriate links (in the `<head>`) to the bootstrap stylesheet and the stylesheet that makes the background green.

2. Then add the appropriate class names to the appropriate divs. All of the classes that you will need to use have been used in `index.html` and/or were highlighted in the videos. 

- Remember that one `div` is the `container` for all of the rows.

- All of the columns need to be nested inside of rows.
Nothing needs to be turned in today.
 
If you need help this assignment, this **[video](https://youtu.be/FFaHpsKRx1E)** walks through about 80% of the assignment along with explanations. The last 20% is for you to complete individually.

## Task 2 - `page3.html`

Expand the Website by adding a third html document named `page3.html`.

- Connect `page3` to both the `style.css` and `bootstrap.css`stylesheets with appropriate links in the `head`.
  - This will make the background color green to match and allow you to apply the bootstrap style classes to the third page.

- Set up the third page to have the following layout
  - A heading with centered text.
  - Hyperlinks to all 3 pages: Home, More Bear Info and Page 3.
    - These hyperlinks should also be updated on `bears.html` and `index.html`
  - A row with filler text on the left (50% width) and a 50% width image of a dog on the right (you can download any dog image that you want). The dog image should resize automatically as the size of the screen changes. For more info on how to accomplish that, look at the other images or view the documentation at [Bootstrap image docs](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/content/images/#responsive-images).
  - A row with 3 equal columns.
    - Each column should have an image of a pig (your choice on the image), and an `h2` that says pigs. 

The 3rd page should look like the mockup below:

## Task 3 - Navbar, Carousel and other advanced bootstrap features.

Follow along in class to use the bootstrap documentation at www.getbootstrap.com. Most of what we do will be a copy and paste, but then you need to update the code to link to your specific pages/images.
